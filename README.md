Java Bootcamp: Individual Application Exercise

This is the TravelCompany java application and comes under the

The application manipulates .csv files as database that keeps 
customer, itinerary and order data. We load those data in the 
begining and we save them in the end of the application. In 
between there are some services that our program is capable 
of doing. It can : 

Add new orders to the database ( .csv file). 
(We check if the data of the new orders are legit and not faul)

We can print some helpful information about our data, like: 
   We print all the existing orders of the system.
   We print all the customers based on some filtes or not.
   We print all the itineraries based on some filters or not.
   We print all the customers that have not made any orders.

This is the basic functionality or our application so far.


Now in order to clone the project and run it you need to do a 
couple of things first.


   We firstly use java 17 to run the application.
   
   I used the Netbeans IDE to implement this app.
   
   There is no difference in cloning or creating a new project
   on your IDE ( from the .git repo I deleted the .gitignore, 
   nbactions.xml files).
   
   I kept the pom.xml file cause I used a maven dependency named 
   javatuple.
   
   The customers.csv, itineraries.csv and orders.csv files are our 
   data set ( you can add and delete easily from those files, feel 
   free to check them).
   
   If you use netbeans to run the project you need to go to 
   team/git/clone etc.
   
   If you handle through github you need to copy paste the project 
   files to your out project folder.


That is it! Thank you for using TravelCompany application.
